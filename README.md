## Use with care

This project is in development, not ready for serious use. A lot of things might change, especially regarding the storage format which right now has one big downside: it leaks entry names.

## Installation

Right now this assumes a rust toolchain is present. As soon as the codebase is more stable I will look into providing binaries.

For now:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stchris/passage.git

# Dependencies for Debian / Ubuntu
$ apt install libxcb-render0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev

$ cargo install --path .
```

## Walkthrough

`passage` assumes a storage folder, whose current default is `~/.local/share/passage/entries/`. You can create this folder by running `passage init` once.


> Note: this might not work on Windows and will be adressed by [Issue #3](https://github.com/stchris/passage/issues/3).

Now let's create a new entry with `$ passage new`:

```
Entry> email
Password for email:
Enter passphrase:
```

So here we are prompted for three things:

* `entry` is the name of the entry we want to create
* `Password for <entry>` is the password we want to store
* `passphrase` is the secret we want to encrypt the password with

Now `passage list` should show one entry (`email`) and we can decrypt this with either:

```
$ passage show email # the password gets copied to the clipboard
```

or

```
$ passage show --on-screen email # the password is printed to the console
```

## Usage

```bash
$ passage
